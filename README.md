# Lattice-iCEBlink40-LP1K
Verilog examples for the Lattice LP1K, QN84 package.
This board is very low power (LP) and inexpensive (< 40$), yet all examples found online target the HX1K.  

The examples are meant to be compiled using the IceStorm toolkit, see https://github.com/cliffordwolf/icestorm and http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/. 

1) btn uses to the capacitive buttons to control LED states
2) cnt implements a binary counter using the onboard LEDs
3) rot lights up one LED at a time indefinitely
